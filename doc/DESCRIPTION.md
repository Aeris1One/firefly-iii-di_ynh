Firefly III Data Importer is the nr. 1 tool to import data into [Firefly III](https://www.firefly-iii.org/). This tools helps you import transactions from files or bank APIs into your
Firefly-III server. Please follow the documentation at https://docs.firefly-iii.org/data-importer/.

If your Firefly-III server is installed as a YunoHost app, please note:

- It should be accessible to all visitors (using its internal user management instead of YunoHosts') for the Data Importer to communicate with it.

- When configuring the Data Importer, use the public Firefly-III domain and path, not *localhost*, even if both services are on the same machine.
